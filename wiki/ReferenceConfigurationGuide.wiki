= Ruby PDNS configuration guide =
Basic configuration goes into _/etc/pdns/pdns-ruby-backend.cfg_ by default, you can though specify an alternative location using the _--config_ command line option.

The config file is a simple INI file format of just _key=val_ pairs, the keys and possible values are listed below.

Comments starting with _#_ and new lines are allowed and will be ignored.

||*Option*||*Sample*||*Possible Values*||*Description||
||logfile||/var/log/pdns/pipe-backend.log||Any file||Where to write log messages to, for debugging you can use /dev/stderr even||
||loglevel||The level to log at||info|error|warn|fatal|debug||Warn is generally a good level to use for production||
||records_dir||/etc/pdns/records||Any directory||Where to find _*.prb_ files||
||reload_interval||60||Integer numbers||How often in seconds to reload records from _records`_`dir_||
||soa_contact||postmaster.your.net||Email address as acceptable in SOA records||We create fake SOA records, this will be the contact||
||soa_nameserver||ns1.your.net||The primary nameserver listed in SOA records||We create fake SOA records, this will be the nameserver||
||keep_logs||10||Integer number||How many logs to keep||
||max_log_size||1024000||Integer number||What size log to keep||
||geoipdb||/var/lib/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat||Full path||Where to find the GeoIP.dat file||
||maint_interval||60||Integer numbers in seconds||How often to run maintenance like dumping stats and clearing caches||

Additional module configuration can be done in this file using lines like these:

{{{
geoip.dblocation = /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat
}}}

The meaning of these will be documented in the docs for each specific module like the [ReferenceGeoIP GeoIP module]

A sample file can be seen below

{{{
# Ruby PowerDNS Config File
logfile = /var/log/pdns/pipe-backend.log
loglevel = info
records_dir = /etc/pdns/records
soa_contact = dns-admin.foo.net
soa_nameserver = ns1.foo.net
reload_interval = 60
keep_logs = 10
max_log_size = 1024000
geoipdb = /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat
maint_interval = 60
geoip.dblocation = /var/lib/GeoIP/GeoIP.dat
}}}

There are many settings in PowerDNS that can affect the performance and effectiveness of this backend, please see [PDNSConfigurationGuide] for details on those
