#summary Graphing PDNS using Cacti

There are several ways to monitor PowerDNS through Cacti, the data template we provide makes use of [http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/nrpe/NRPE.pdf NRPE] (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor).

Therefore the following steps will apply just to the above method but with a bit of fiddling you can use it with other input methods such SNMP.

PowerDNS Server Part

 * Place *cacti_pdns.rb* under your */usr/local/bin* path
 * If you run your nrpe plugins under an unprivileged user (e.g nagios) then you will have to add to your sudoers file an entry like: 
{{{
nagios ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/cacti_pdns.rb
}}}
 * Create a configuration file for the nrpe plugin and set up the check as follows: 
{{{
command[check_cacti-pdns]=sudo /usr/local/bin/cacti_pdns.rb
}}}

Cacti Part

 * Import the templates into Cacti through the Console management under Import/Export templates.
 * Once imported you will have to set up the Data Sources for the hosts on which you have PowerDNS running in order to fetch the data from them.
 * Last step will be creating the graphs for PowerDNS hosts. As data needs collecting it might take a while for the graphs to show up with some relevant information.
