== TODO List ==
 * Report stats, at present each instance keeps query count stats per record, but no reporting of that yet
 * Some kind of handling of external data like monitoring data that can then be used in record logic
 * Give each record block an id and track that id, answering _AXFR id_ questions correctly with a per record SOA block
 * Redirect STDOUT to /dev/null or something till we are ready to construct the answer
 * Make components like the GeoIP capability a plugin so others can easily write and extend
 * Provide a Caching system that modules like GeoIP can use
