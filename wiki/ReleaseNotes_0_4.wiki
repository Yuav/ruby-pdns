#summary Release Notes for 0.4
#labels Phase-Deploy,Featured

= Introduction =
We're pleased to announce release 0.4 of Ruby PDNS.

Release 0.3 was a feature complete release but lacked full exception handling, the 0.4 branch is primarily concerned with stability and as such has a lot of new exception handling, unit test coverage and some code refactoring to make future releases easier.

In addition to robustness improvements we've now added a tool that can be used to test your records outside of your nameserver, this should help with syntax and logic checking even with GeoIP as you can specify custom source addresses etc.  See [TestingRecords]

This release is available as a tarball, RPM, Source RPM and RubyGem on the [http://code.google.com/p/ruby-pdns/downloads/list downloads] page.

== Upgrading ==
We now provide a RubyGem for operating systems other than RedHat, it's a new release target and will be the preferred method for non RedHat systems till we can get a volunteer to build proper packages for other distros.

=== Source Installs ===
To upgrade using the RubyGem if you installed by hand in the past please do:

 * Make note of your Ruby Site Lib Directory: ruby -rrbconfig -e "puts Config::CONFIG'sitelibdir'"
 * Delete _pdns.rb_ from your Ruby Sitelib Directory
 * Delete the _pdns_ directory from your Ruby Sitelib Directory
 * Delete _/usr/sbin/pdns-pipe-runner.rb_

Now follow the install guide as if you're a new install of RubyGems

=== RPM Installs ===
The RPM should cleanly upgrade using just _rpm -Uvh ruby-pdns-0.4.el5.noarch.rpm_

=== Configuration ===
This release requires you to make changes to your config file, for a full reference of the config file please see [ReferenceConfigurationGuide_0_4 Configuration Reference], the changes in this release are:

 * The old _geoipdb_ option has been removed, should now be _geoip.dblocation_
 * A new option has been added - _maint_interval_ - this defaults to 60
