= Rough Draft =

Doing RPM test:
* build a rc RPM, need to comment out the gem stuff cos they want pure numeric 
* rm -rf /etc/pdns/pdns-ruby-backend.cfg* /etc/pdns/records /var/log/pdns
* rpm -ivh ruby-pdns-0.4-rc1.el5.noarch.rpm
* configure as per wiki docs
* copy test suite onto the machine - test suite only not the whole app
* run test suite against installed copy of ruby-pdns
* copy sample test records onto server and test with dig from remote machine

Doing Release Candidate:
* set ENV variables to make rc, rake rpm  after commenting out the gem tasks
* tar the release
* upload tar, rpm and srpm to google code
* copy the reference docs to release ones if major release
* update changelog
